# Playwright Test Investigation Report

## Summary
Playwright is successfully installed and configured, but **19 out of 21 tests failed** due to the development server not being running. The tests are attempting to connect to `http://localhost:5173` but receiving `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Development Server Not Running
- **Error**: `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at http://localhost:5173/`
- **Impact**: 19/21 tests failed
- **Cause**: The Vite development server is not running when tests execute

### Successful Tests
Only 2 tests passed:
1. `[chromium] › tests/example.spec.ts:3:1 › has title`
2. `[chromium] › tests/example.spec.ts:10:1 › get started link`

These likely passed because they don't require the actual application to be running (probably testing static content or external sites).

## Failed Test Categories

### 1. Data Validation Tests (4 failures)
- TC014: Question Data Integrity
- TC015: Score Calculation  
- TC015b: Mixed Correct/Incorrect Score Calculation
- TC014b: Timer Data Validation

### 2. Edge Cases (3 failures)
- TC012: Rapid Answer Selection
- TC013: Browser Refresh
- TC012b: Multiple Button Clicks

### 3. Game State Tests (2 failures)
- TC008: Restart Quiz
- TC009: Question Navigation

### 4. Quiz Flow Tests (5 failures)
- TC001: Start Quiz
- TC002: Answer Selection
- TC003: Correct Answer Scoring
- TC004: Incorrect Answer Handling
- TC005: Complete Quiz

### 5. Timer Tests (2 failures)
- TC006: Timer Countdown
- TC007: Timer Expiry

### 6. UI/UX Tests (3 failures)
- TC010: Responsive Design
- TC011: Visual Feedback
- TC011b: Timer Visual Feedback

## Playwright Installation Status

✅ **Successfully Installed Components:**
- `@playwright/test` package (v1.54.2)
- Playwright browsers (with warnings about system dependencies)
- Test configuration in `playwright.config.ts`
- Test scripts in `package.json`

⚠️ **System Warnings:**
- OS not officially supported (using ubuntu22.04-x64 fallback)
- Some missing system libraries (libflite dependencies, libavif)
- These warnings don't prevent basic functionality

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix
1. **Start the development server** before running tests:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start Vite on `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Run tests in a separate terminal**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

### Better Long-term Solution
Configure Playwright to automatically start the dev server by uncommenting and modifying the `webServer` section in `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
webServer: {
  command: 'npm run dev',
  url: 'http://localhost:5173',
  reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
},
```

### Alternative Testing Approaches
1. **Headed mode for debugging**: `npm run test:debug`
2. **UI mode for interactive testing**: `npm run test:ui`
3. **Specific browser testing**: `npx playwright test --project=chromium`

## Test Structure Analysis
The test suite is comprehensive and well-organized:
- **21 total tests** across 6 categories
- Tests cover: data validation, edge cases, game state, quiz flow, timer functionality, and UI/UX
- Each test properly navigates to the app and waits for network idle state
- Good separation of concerns with individual spec files

## Recommendations

1. **Enable webServer in playwright.config.ts** for automated dev server management
2. **Add a test script** that ensures the dev server is running: `"test:with-server": "npm run dev & sleep 3 && npm run test"`
3. **Consider adding CI/CD configuration** that properly starts the server before tests
4. **Install missing system dependencies** if you plan to run tests in headful mode or need audio features

## Next Steps

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. In a new terminal, run the tests: `npm run test`
3. All tests should now pass (assuming the application functionality is correct)
4. Configure automatic server startup for future test runs
